## Overview of PyBer Ride Sharing Data Analysis

### Purpose
Completed an analysis of PyBer Ride Sharing Data across a cross-section of markets.

Provided the following assessments:

1. For each PyBer city type, calculated the following:
	* Total number of rides
	* Total number of drivers
	* Total fares
	* Average fare per ride
	* Average fare per driver

2. Prepared a multiple-line graph depicting total fareas for each week between January 1 and April 28, 2019 by city type
